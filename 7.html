<h2 id="applying-some-basic-minimalism-in-my-life">Applying Some Basic Minimalism in my Life</h2>
<p>After my analysis of time in my previous post: <a href="https://medium.com/@maxloopinmok/are-we-starved-of-time-everyday-what-we-can-do-about-it-f2fc9d75ce5e">https://medium.com/<span class="citation" data-cites="maxloopinmok/are-we-starved-of-time-everyday-what-we-can-do-about-it-f2fc9d75ce5e">@maxloopinmok/are-we-starved-of-time-everyday-what-we-can-do-about-it-f2fc9d75ce5e</span></a></p>
<p>My mind was drawn towards the idea of minimalism. My current self analysis follows from the book “Simplify: A Start-up Guide to Minimalism” from “Simplicity: Finding Joy Through A Minimalist Lifestyle (4 Books in 1 Minimalism Bundle)”.</p>
As of now, I can identify 5 personal values to live on:
<ul>
<li>
Gratitude: to express gratitude that there’s a God in my life
</li>
<li>
Wisdom: to grow in wisdom
</li>
<li>
Responsibility: to be responsible with what I do and say
</li>
<li>
Contribution: to grow in contributions in work and life
</li>
<li>
Openness: to be open with what I’ve learnt
</li>
</ul>
<p>My goals or purposes in life are simple: * Simplify life so that I can be effective at work so that I can earn enough to live properly. * Ensure that my personal values are satisfied.</p>
<p>These are my space decluttering tasks: * donate away books i no longer need * trash/recycle papers and electronic devices i no longer need * relocate holders and containers of trashed papers and devices</p>
<p>Space decluttering requires decision making skills: * choose books relevant to my needs * replace older books with ebooks that may be updated</p>
<p>This is my time decluttering analysis: * schedule around priorities of need, importance and immediacy * practise routine time segmentation: before lunch, hours in office, going home period, after dinner</p>
<p>My time decluttering analysis follows and adds to my previous analysis: https://medium.com/<span class="citation" data-cites="maxloopinmok/time-management-and-prioritising-based-on-my-current-work-9cf892fac9e2">@maxloopinmok/time-management-and-prioritising-based-on-my-current-work-9cf892fac9e2</span></p>
<p>My relationships are simple. I have few family members, relatives, friends, colleagues, and one God. My finances are quite simple too. I pay for only what is needed, such as food, clothes, transport, medicals, books, cleaners, insect control, technology requirements, and utilities and conservancies. Unfortunately, I also have to pay a larger sum of money every month for my father’s stay in a nursing home due to his dementia.</p>
